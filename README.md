# Data Transformation Project Overview

Hello! My name is Riley Berrey and I'm a graduate student in Health Informatics and Information Management with a background in Public Health. Currently, I am enriching the digital health landscape as a Clinical Product/Research Consultant at Commure, a forward-thinking digital health startup.

## Project Description
This project involves creating mock schemas and simulating data transformation processes typically found in data warehousing or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. The project showcases the creation and manipulation of a source schema and a target schema, focusing on transforming data from the source tables to the target tables.

## Key Features
Source Schema Creation: The source schema represents the original data set, consisting of two main tables: patients and encounters.
Target Schema Creation: A target schema is created to store transformed data, demonstrating a typical data warehousing scenario.
Data Transformation: The project highlights various data transformation techniques applied to transfer data from the source schema to the target schema.

## Disclaimer
This data set does not contain real patient information. All patient and encounter data are entirely fictional and generated for demonstration purposes.

## File Structure
The SQL file contains structured commands to create source and target schemas, along with mock data generation for the patients and encounters tables. It serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding basic to intermediate SQL operations in a data transformation context.

## Usage
This project is ideal for users who are interested in learning about SQL data manipulation, schema creation, and data transformation techniques. It can be used as a learning tool or a template for similar projects.

## This README provides a concise summary of your project based on the initial content of the SQL file. You might want to add more details or sections depending on the full content of your file and the specific aspects you want to highlight in your GitHub repository.
